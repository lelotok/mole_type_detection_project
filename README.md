# Project deep Learning: Mole prediction App

### By [Lelo Tokwaulu](www.linkedin.com/in/lelotokwaulu)
--------------------------------------------------------
## Description 

Creating an App that will predict mole type using just a image of a mole.

## Modules used

- Python
- Pandas
- Numpy
- tensorflow
- Keras
- os
- pathlib
- Sklearn
- Flask
- matplotlib

## Installation

1. Clone the repo
2. Install the libraries (check requirements.txt)
3. Run app.py

## Starting and running

1. Open app in a browser
2. upload an mole img/png
3. Click button 'Predict'

## Output

A text ('Mole type is: ') will pop up with mole type.

## Data

Model trained based on Skin cancer data from Kaggle 
https://www.kaggle.com/kmader/skin-cancer-mnist-ham10000

## Model

Used a Keras pre-trained model 'mobilenet_v2' to train the dataset. Maybe need to test other pre-trained for better accuracy.

## Note:

This is first version, model need to be refined as the app design. 

## Acknowledges

Thank you!
